# Nitro Imager

This tool serves as a server-side habbo-imager using the same avatar generator from nitro-renderer. It will download & cache in memory ``.nitro`` assets. Rendered figures will also save to a local folder to prevent re-renders. You will use the same process as your nitro-client to update assets for the imager.

## Configuration

You must configure your urls in `config.json`

Your figuredata, figuremap, effectmap, & HabboAvatarActions can safely point to a remote URL without worrying about performance.

You should set all download urls to local absolute paths on your system, this will allow for faster downloading of figures. However, you may point to remote urls as well.

You must also set an absolute path to a location where rendered figures can save to. This can be a private folder that is not accessible from the web.

## Running the server

**Make sure you run ``npm i`` before first use.**

You must compile the server by running ``npm run build``

To start the server you must run ``npm start``

The server will run on the desired host & port as set in the config. You must setup a reverse proxy on your server to make the imager publicly accessible.

NGINX Example

	server {
		listen 80;
		listen [::]:80;
		
		listen 443;
		listen [::]:443;
		
		server_name habbo-imaging.website.com;
		
		location / {
			proxy_pass                  http://localhost:1338;
			proxy_set_header        Host $host;
			proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
			proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		}
	}


## URL paramaters

Their are a few different options you may pass as URL parameters to generate figures with different actions. All parameters are optional.

| key | default | description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| figure | null | The figure string to be rendered |
| action | null | The actions to render, see actions below  |
| gesture | std | The gesture to render, see gestures below  |
| direction | 2 | The direction to render, from 0-7 |
| head_direction | 2 | The head direction to render, from 0-7 |
| headonly | 0 | A value of ``0`` or ``1`` |
| dance | 0 | A dance id of 0-4 to render |
| effect | 0 | An effect id to render |
| size | n | The size to render, see sizes below |
| frame_num | 0 | The frame number to render |
| img_format | png | A value of ``png`` or ``gif``. Gif will render all frames of the figure |

## Actions

You may render multiple actions with a comma separater

Example: ``&action=wlk,wav,drk=1``
##### Posture
| key | description |
| ------ | ------ |
| std | Renders the standing posture |
| wlk,mv | Renders the walking posture |
| sit | Renders the sitting posture |
| lay | Renders the laying posture |

##### Expression
| key | description |
| ------ | ------ |
| wav,wave | Renders the waving expression |
| blow | Renders the kissing expression |
| laugh | Renders the laughing expression |
| respect | Renders the respect expression |

##### Carry / Drink
To hold a certain drink, use an equal separator with the hand item id. You can only render one of these options at a time

| key | description |
| ------ | ------ |
| crr,cri | Renders the carry action |
| drk,usei | Renders the drink action |

## Gestures
| key | description |
| ------ | ------ |
| std | Renders the standard gesture |
| agr | Renders the aggravated gesture |
| sad | Renders the sad gesture |
| sml | Renders the smile gesture |
| srp | Renders the surprised gesture |

## Sizes
| key | description |
| ------ | ------ |
| s | Renders the small size (0.5) |
| n | Renders the normal size (1) |
| l | Renders the large size (2) |

## Known Issues
* GIFs are only able to render 1 bit alpha channels, therefore most effects will not correctly render due to using many different alpha values.
* The rendered canvas size may not match habbos imager exactly, we will hopefully have this addressed soon.
